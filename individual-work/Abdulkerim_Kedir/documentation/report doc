1️⃣ Introduction
The Vehicle Rental System is a project developed to allow people to rent vehicles efficiently. The system is built using Java and follows basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to manage vehicles, customers, and rentals. The project aims to create a simple but functional rental service, where users can register, book vehicles, and view availability through a console-based application.
As a student working on this project, I tried to apply what I learned in class, but I faced several challenges while structuring the code and organizing the workflow properly.

2️⃣ Objectives of the System
The main purpose of the system is to:
✅ Enable vehicle rentals by keeping track of available cars
✅ Store customer information securely for proper rental management
✅ Process rentals correctly, ensuring that only available vehicles are rented
✅ Improve code readability using beginner-friendly formatting
Initially, I wanted to implement GPS tracking, but due to hardware requirements, I couldn’t add that feature.

3️⃣ System Features
🔹 View Available Vehicles – Displays all cars that can be rented
🔹 Customer Registration – Stores user details like name, license, and phone number
🔹 Process Rentals – Allows renting of a vehicle while updating its availability
🔹 Structured Console Interaction – Uses color-coded output to enhance readability
I designed the system in a way that it would be easy to understand and follow the instructor’s rules.
4️⃣ Technologies Used
🟢 Programming Language: Java
🟢 Development Environment: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA
🟢 Version Control: GitHub (which I had to learn from YouTube tutorials)
🟢 Data Structures: ArrayLists (for storing vehicles, customers, and rentals)
At first, I struggled with GitHub, but after watching tutorials and practicing, I understood how repositories and commits work.

5️⃣ Challenges Faced
Developing the system was not easy, especially since I had to learn new concepts while applying basic programming skills. Here are the main challenges I faced:
🔹 Learning GitHub – I had no prior knowledge, so I had to watch several tutorials
🔹 Structuring the project – I didn’t know how to combine different components into a real-world system
🔹 GPS Tracking Limitations – I couldn’t implement it due to hardware requirements
🔹 Code Organization – Writing a clean, structured code format was difficult in the beginning
Despite these obstacles, I kept improving the project step by step.

6️⃣ Project Outcomes & Achievements
✅ Successfully built a rental system following proper OOP principles
✅ Improved understanding of GitHub and version control basics
✅ Created a well-structured code with color formatting for readability
✅ Learned how to manage multiple objects (vehicles, customers, rentals)
Although GPS tracking remains a future challenge, the current system works efficiently based on the given requirements.

7️⃣ Future Enhancements
💡 Adding payment integration for a complete rental experience
💡 Implementing GPS tracking using external APIs
💡 Building a graphical interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly design
These improvements could make the system more realistic and professional.
8️⃣ Conclusion
Developing the Vehicle Rental System was a great learning experience, even though I faced difficulties along the way. The project helped me improve my understanding of Java, GitHub, object-oriented programming, and real-world software development principles. While some features like GPS tracking were not implemented, the system meets the requirements set by the instructor and provides basic rental functionalities. 🚀
