Challenges Faced in Developing the Vehicle Rental System
Developing the Vehicle Rental System came with multiple challenges, especially as a beginner navigating both technical tools and project structuring principles. Below is a detailed explanation of the key challenges faced during development.

1, Learning GitHub from Scratch
One of the most difficult challenges was understanding how to use GitHub, as there was no prior experience with version control systems.
?Initially, GitHub seemed complex and overwhelming, requiring multiple steps to upload files, create repositories, and track changes.
?Watching YouTube tutorials helped gain an understanding, but applying Git commands correctly and managing branches took time.
?The workflow confusion—whether to commit, push, or pull—made managing progress difficult.
Despite these difficulties, using GitHub became easier over time, allowing better organization and collaboration. While some concepts like pull requests and merging still required additional learning, the basic functionality was successfully applied.

2 Structuring a Real-World Project
Another major challenge was organizing a full system beyond basic Java concepts.
?Understanding how different classes should interact (Vehicle, Customer, Rental, and MainSystem) was tricky.
?Combining different components into a cohesive system required following step-by-step rules from the instructor.
?At first, there was confusion on which methods belong to which class, causing errors in object relationships.
?Developing a logical flow of execution (user interaction ? data storage ? retrieval) was difficult without clear planning.
Over time, structuring improved by following UML diagrams and adjusting the code through iteration, resulting in a well-organized system.

3 Difficulty Implementing GPS Tracking
The GPS tracking feature was one of the biggest obstacles due to hardware limitations.
?The project required real-time GPS data, but accessing hardware like GPS modules or APIs wasn't feasible.
?Without proper hardware, implementing location tracking became technically impractical within the Java-based system.
?Alternative solutions like mock data simulation were considered, but they didn’t fully meet the project requirements.
This feature remains an unresolved challenge, but could be implemented in the future with external APIs or physical GPS modules.

4 Structuring Code for Readability
Ensuring clean and readable code was another difficulty, especially in formatting and organizing logic.
Writing long functions made debugging harder, requiring code splitting into smaller, structured methods.
?Keeping proper indentation and naming conventions took extra effort.
?Understanding stream filtering and organizing data retrieval methods correctly was confusing at first.
By refining the code iteratively, following beginner-friendly naming conventions, and ensuring proper structuring, the final version became more readable and functional.

?? Conclusion
The Vehicle Rental System development was filled with technical challenges ranging from learning GitHub, structuring real-world projects, integrating GPS tracking, and writing clean code. Despite the obstacles, consistent learning, following project rules, and iterative improvement led to a functional, well-organized system. Future improvements, especially in hardware integration and advanced features, will help make the system even better.
