<h1>Domain 10: Real Estate Listing Platform</h1>

<h2>Project Description </h2>
<p>
  This project focuses on modeling a real estate listing platform using object-oriented programming. 
  The idea is to build a system where users can register as buyers, sellers, or agents, and interact 
  with property listings in a structured way.
</p>
<p>
  Sellers and agents should be able to add new properties, update details, and remove listings when sold 
  or unavailable. Buyers should be able to browse and search through available listings using filters 
  like location, price range, and property type. The platform should also allow buyers to save their 
  favorite listings and contact the seller or agent for more information.
</p>

<h2>Scope of the System</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User registration and login for three roles: buyer, seller, and agent</li>
  <li>Creation and management of property listings (title, price, location, description, images)</li>
  <li>Search and filter features for browsing listings</li>
  <li>Option for buyers to save favorite properties</li>
  <li>Basic messaging or inquiry system to contact the listing owner</li>
  <li>Separation of user roles with appropriate permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The system will be modeled using OOP concepts like classes, attributes, methods, and relationships 
  between objects. For example, a seller may own multiple listings, while a listing belongs to one 
  seller or agent.
