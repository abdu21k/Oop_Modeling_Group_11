<h1>Domain 10: Real Estate Listing Platform</h1>

<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>
  This project aims to design and model a real estate listing platform using object-oriented programming. 
  The system should allow users to sign up either as buyers, sellers, or real estate agents, and interact with property listings in meaningful ways.
</p>
<p>
  Sellers and agents can create, edit, and delete their property listings. Each listing should include important details such as title, price, location, property type, images, and a description. Buyers should be able to search for properties using filters (e.g., price range, location, property type), view property details, and save listings theyâ€™re interested in.
</p>
<p>
  The platform should also support basic communication between buyers and sellers/agents through inquiries or a simple messaging feature. All users must have their own accounts, and their access or functionality should be based on their role.
</p>

<h2>Scope of the System</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User registration and login for buyers, sellers, and agents</li>
  <li>Role-based access and basic profile management</li>
  <li>Creation, update, and deletion of property listings</li>
  <li>Search and filtering options for property browsing</li>
  <li>Saving favorite properties (for buyers)</li>
  <li>Basic inquiry system (contact seller or agent)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The system will be modeled using core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and object relationships. For example, a seller or agent can manage multiple property listings, while each property is linked to exactly one owner.
