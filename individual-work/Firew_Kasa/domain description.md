# Hotel Reservation System Full Project Description

## Project Title

**Hotel Reservation System**

## Objective

The main objective of the Hotel Reservation System is to simplify the process of booking hotel rooms for customers and managing reservations for hotel staff. It aims to make hotel operations more organized, reduce paperwork, and enhance the customer experience by offering an efficient, user-friendly interface for booking rooms.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, managing hotel room bookings manually is inefficient and prone to human error. A hotel reservation system solves this issue by allowing guests to reserve rooms online or in person, while also helping hotel staff manage room availability, customer details, billing, and more. This project is designed to cover all the essential functionalities required to operate a small-to-medium-sized hotel smoothly.

## Problem Statement

Without an automated system, hotel reservations are often handled manually through registers or spreadsheets, which can lead to double bookings, lost records, and customer dissatisfaction. There is also a lack of proper communication between departments. The goal of this system is to replace outdated manual processes with a modern digital system that minimizes errors and saves time for both staff and customers.

## Scope of the Project

The Hotel Reservation System is intended for hotels of varying sizes. It will cover the following areas:

- Guest room booking  
- Room availability status  
- Customer check-in and check-out management  
- Billing and invoice generation  
- Storing customer details and booking history  
- Admin functionalities like room updates, price setting, and reservation control  

## System Users

The system will be used by two main types of users:

- **Hotel Staff / Admins**: Can add or edit room details, view and manage reservations, and handle customer check-in/check-out.  
- **Customers / Guests**: Can browse available rooms, book them, and view their reservation details.
