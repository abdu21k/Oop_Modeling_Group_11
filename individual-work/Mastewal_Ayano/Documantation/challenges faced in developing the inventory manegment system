# Challenges Faced During Development

## 1. Designing the Class Structure
- Identifying essential classes such as `Product` and `InventorySystem`.
- Deciding how to store and manage the list of products dynamically.

## 2. Handling User Input
- Managing input with `Scanner`, especially mixing `nextLine()` with `nextInt()`.
- Preventing the program from skipping inputs or crashing due to unexpected input.

## 3. Validating Input
- Ensuring valid product IDs are entered before processing purchase or sale.
- Preventing users from entering negative or zero quantities.

## 4. Managing Stock Correctly
- Updating product quantities accurately during purchase and sale operations.
- Handling cases where users try to sell more items than are available.

## 5. Keeping the Code Simple
- Avoiding complex features to maintain clarity and beginner-friendliness.
- Ensuring the logic is easy to follow, especially in the console menu.

## 6. No Persistent Storage
- Since data is stored only in memory (`ArrayList`), all products are lost after exiting.
- Made it necessary to fully test during a single run.

## 7. Debugging Logic Errors
- Fixing issues where product selection or quantity updates didnâ€™t work as expected.
- Verifying that all user inputs correctly trigger the right system behavior.
