## Title:
Challenges in Managing Inventory Transactions and Stock Movements

## Description:
Inventory management is a critical aspect of any business that deals with physical products, whether it's a retail store, warehouse, or supply chain. However, many small to medium-sized businesses in Ethiopia and elsewhere still rely on manual systems such as paper records or basic spreadsheets to track their inventory. This leads to several recurring problems:

1. **Inaccurate Stock Levels** – Without automated updates, it’s easy to overstock or run out of products without realizing it.  
2. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility** – Manual systems don’t reflect real-time changes, making it hard to know what's currently available or where it is stored.  
3. **Transaction Errors** – Purchases, sales, and stock movements are not consistently recorded, which causes data mismatch and confusion.  
4. **Difficult Reporting** – Managers and business owners struggle to quickly generate accurate reports on product availability, losses, or performance.  
5. **No Central System** – If a business has multiple storage locations, it’s challenging to manage transfers and keep records updated across all of them.  

These issues reduce efficiency, lead to financial losses, and make decision-making harder for business owners.
