▎Project Description:

Food delivery is a courier service  in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either by telephone, through the supplier's website  or mobile app, or through a third party food ordering service. The delivered items can include enteers, sides, drinks dessert,or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.

• Intuitive User  Interface:
A user-friendly design makes it   easy for customers to browse menus and customize orders.
• Easy Order Placement:
Streamlined ordering processes, including multiple payment options and secure transactions. 
• Real-time Order Tracking:
Customers can monitor the status of their orders from preparation to delivery, reducing anxiety and enhancing trust. 
• Customization and Personalization:
Options for customizing orders, saving favorite orders, and receiving personalized recommendations based on past orders. 
• Payment Integration:
Secure and reliable payment gateways that support various methods, including credit cards, digital wallets, and cash on.
